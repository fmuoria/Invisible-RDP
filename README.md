# Invisible-RDP

## Project Overview
Invisible-RDP is a remote desktop protocol implementation focused on providing seamless access while ensuring user control and ethical usage. The project aims to deliver a robust solution with transparency at its core, allowing users to maintain control over their remote access sessions.

## Ethical Guidelines
This project adheres to strict ethical guidelines to promote secure and responsible use. All users must explicitly consent to remote access and are entitled to be informed about the nature of their sessions. 

## Technical Architecture
The architecture of Invisible-RDP comprises multiple layers designed for efficiency and security. It integrates key components that work synergistically to ensure a responsive and secure remote access experience for users.

## Consent Workflow
A rigorous consent workflow is implemented to ensure that users grant permission for any remote access sessions. Informed consent is obtained from users at the onset, which includes details on session duration and access rights.

## Modules Description
- **Service**: This module handles the core functionality of the remote desktop service, allowing connections between clients and hosts.
- **Consent**: Responsible for managing user consent, ensuring that all access is agreed upon and documented.
- **Session**: Manages the lifecycle of remote desktop sessions, including initiation, monitoring, and termination, while providing real-time feedback to users.
- **Audit**: Tracks all actions and access attempts for accountability, generating logs that are crucial for compliance and security assessments.
- **Registry**: Maintains a record of authorized sessions and user permissions, facilitating easy management and review of accesses.
- **Uninstall**: Provides a straightforward mechanism for users to remove the application, ensuring that they can easily revoke access to their systems.

## Security and Compliance
Security is paramount in Invisible-RDP. The project complies with relevant data protection regulations, ensuring that user data is handled with utmost care. Regular security audits are conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Testing Procedures
Testing is an integral part of the development process, with unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) performed to guarantee stability and performance. Testing covers all modules to ensure reliability and secure operations.
